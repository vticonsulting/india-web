          <h2>OSE Reflection</h2>

          <p>Summer 2019 was the first time I was back in a classroom as a student after ten years. As excited as I was to be working towards my career goal, I was nervous about this experience. Near the end of the semester, I did not realize that this journey was not going to be a pleasant stroll but a full race ahead. I needed to find a job and fast because unpaid student teaching will not help pay tuition. Job searching became a daunting task while working a summer job between classes. I filled out many online application without receiving a callback. When I did receive a phone call from Fulton County for their Teacher Bank, I thought I fumbled the phone interview. Lucky I made the bank, but still did not receive a position. After going to a Dekalb County Job Fair and not having great luck, I started to make alternate plans towards fulfilling course requirements for the University. A week before students were planned to go back to school; I received an interview and a job offer at Stone Mountain Middle School teaching sixth grade Math. I am lucky to call myself a Pirate officially.</p>

          <p>Stone Mountain Middle School is located in Stone Mountain, Georgia. As reported on March 7, 2019, there were 1,027 students enrolled in sixth through eighth grade. Currently, there are 328 sixth grader. The breakdown of student demographics in Stone Mountain Middle School (SMMS) are, 81.4% identify as Black or African American, 8.7% as Hispanic or Latino of any race, 6.8% as Asian, 1.7% as White, .7% as two or more races, .4% as American Indian or Alaska Native, and .2% Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander. 13.3% of the student population was reported to be students with disabilities, and of those students, .7% only have a 504 plan. 10% of the students' population are students with Limited English Proficiency (Civil Rights Data Collection, Stone Mountain Middle School, n.d.). The student demographics, compared to my previous elementary teaching position in central Fulton County, does lack diversity. Coming from a school where there was a close percentage of minorities to a school where there is an overwhelming percentage of one race is an adjustment, although I am an African American teacher. It is my goal to teach my students tolerance and to be a global citizen, although their surrounding may not reflect the diverse world in which we live. I do, however, like that the staff’s diversity reflects the student population. Student benefit for having a teaching staff that looks like them and relate to their cultural needs. Connecting to the staff helps the student and teacher relationship (Dilworth, M. and Coleman, M., 2014).</p>

          <p>During Pre-planning, I missed the first two days due to the process of waiting for my employment paperwork to be processed through the school district. My first day in my classroom and meeting the staff was one day ahead of open house. I was introduced to the team and quickly given the list of everything that was required of me to have in my room. I learned that each grade is broken into teams. Each team has one teacher for each core subject (Math, Social Studies, Science, and Language Arts) and resource teachers for various subjects. Sixth grade has four teams, 6A, 6B, 6C, and 6D. 6D team is an exception to the rule because it is a two teacher team, with both teachers teaching more than one subject. I belong to team 6A; we are a seven teacher team. Everyone on the team has been warm and welcoming. Each teacher has offered to provide any assistance if needed.</p>

          <p>Also, I am lucky to be on a team with more than one veteran teacher, that can offer me valuable advice. During the afternoon of my first day, I was introduced to my co-teacher, Ms. Pierce. Ms. Pierce will co-teach with me during the second and fourth periods. She is one of the veteran teachers on the team and co-teaching with her has eased some nervousness of being a first-year teacher. Being a paraprofessional previously in a co-taught setting, I understand the importance of collaborating and effective communication. Some co-taught teams that did not work in my previous school was because of the lack of communication. I can learn from their mistakes to ensure that my team remains strong through the school year.</p>

          <p>The second day of pre-planning, I spent the morning at the new staff orientation for the school district. This caused me to miss time for setting up my classroom and also the first hour and a half of Open House. I had not spent much time with my team, and I did not have an opportunity to meet my content team, which means I did not have much insight of the school year to offer to the parents and students at Open House. The team showed me what real teamwork is, by filling in for my absence and leading the welcoming knowing I lacked previous knowledge of the school’s routines and norms. After Open House, I met Ms. Franks. Ms. Franks is the sixth grade Math content chairperson, and she will serve as a mentor for sixth grade new teachers through the Dekalb County Schools. Ms. Franks gave me a template for the course syllabus and talked about her routines and norms as well as the school's. Having that talk gave me a guide to follow when setting my expectations and standards for my class.</p>

          <p>The third day consisted of a staff meeting and content meeting. During the staff meeting, we discussed the county and school policy and sexual harassment and bullying. We went over important information within the staff handbook and reviewed the first week of school expectations. We must handout the student handbook, go over the school’s code of conduct, and administer the discipline/student code of conduct test. As well as go over the school’s PBIS expectation and take the critical ten-day attendance count. Our principal, Dr. Hinton, discussed his staff expectation as well as the yearly staff meeting calendar. The librarian spoke about how student’s Chromebooks will be given out and that we must give out and collect the permission forms before students can receive a Chromebook. After the staff meeting, we attended breakout sessions with our content. The Math content chairperson for the school, Ms. Blake, went over the new county required template for lesson plans. Also, she gave out a copy of each grade level’s curriculum-at-a-glance, and we had a chance to look at the first county assessment of the year. The first pre-assessment must be upload into the Illuminate application. Ms. Blake made sure everyone understood how to access Illuminate and how to upload the assessment. She also made sure I knew how to access the curriculum in the Verge application. Also, she spoke on the expectations for the grade-level content meeting and what should take place during these meetings. After that breakout session, I was able to meet with the sixth-grade math team to plan for the upcoming week. This put me at easy because my anxiousness was taking over. The team went over the first unit and the curriculum-at-a-glance, to determine what we will focus on the next two weeks. We found resources and a few things that could be used as assessments. Ms. Franks spoke on the importance the county and the school place on assessing the students daily. Mostly the third day was full of the bureaucracy of teaching.</p>

          <p>The fourth day the staff attend a Region VI pep rally with the Region Superintendent, Dr. Michelle Jones, hosting. Dr. Jones praised all the schools in the region that made gains in different areas. Also, she set the tone for the school year as to what the district expects from the “Best and Brightest” district’s teachers. After the pep rally, I had time in my room to set-up for the first day and decided what I what will be the norms of the class. Everyone stressed the importance of setting norms on the first day. During the course Literacy in the Content Area, we read a book be Kathleen Beers she wrote about the importance of creating a classroom that encourages risk, encourages community and provide various ways for engagement (Beers, 2003). I decided that I wanted my room to be an open place to learn and make mistakes. Mistakes are welcome because this is how we learn what not do in the future. I made a basic list of expectations and norms on a slide that we reviewed every day the first two weeks of school. It was basic because I wanted to students to help create some of the norms to make them accountable for creating a positive classroom environment. My rules and standards are as followed: Come in the class with a positive attitude; Turn in any assignments to the correct basket; Check the Promethean Board for further instructions for a bell activity or something else; Be respectful; No making fun of mistakes; Come prepared with materials and ready to learn. After observing how the team interacts with the students. I decided to have a talk with the students about having a positive attitude and creating a positive environment.</p>

          <p>We talked about how a smile can go a long way. We never know when some else may be having a bad day, and just our smile can brighten their mood. A simple good morning can make someone else's day. Also, the way they enter my room, they get to chance start over and have a refresh. If they had a bad day in another class, when they enter my room, they get to make a choice to turn around their day. Also, I promised not to take my frustration with another period on them. Every class I get to start a new as well. The students responded very well to the conversation. I thought this was necessary because I believed that the other teachers were being very harsh when trying to implement rules because of their experience with the previous class. The last sixth-grade class had many behavior issues, and they seemed to want to lay the hammer down early and hard because of the previous class. By letting the students know that I would not hold whatever happened in their other classes against them, that my room is a fresh start, their behavior and demeanor in my room was much more pleasant than in other classrooms. Throughout the first weeks, I stressed the theme of positivity, so much I heard the students correcting each other, by saying “that’s not positive” or “you need to be more positive.”</p>

          <p>In the Culturally Responsive Classroom Leadership course, we did an activity in which we made a course charter of what our rights and responsibilities are students and what we needed and expected for the professor. In the end, we all agreed that we will be responsible for upholding the course charter. I decide to do a similar activity with my homeroom. The students labeled six sticky notes one through six. On each sticky note, they filled in the blank to one of the following statements. The best teachers are the ones who __. The most helpful classmates are the ones who _____. One of my strengths in Math is ________. One of my weaknesses Math is ____. To produce my best work, I need __. By the end of the year, I plan to achieve the following goal: __. I then broke the class up into six groups. Each group had to place the sticky note on the corresponding number question on a sticky flip chart paper placed around the room. Next, they discussed their answer. The students were given a few minutes at each question. Once the group returned to their original starting place. The group had to report on the class response to each question assigned to their group.</p>

          <p>The next day I explained to them that the activity not only allowed them to move around the class but also to show me how well they could work together and communicate with each other. They now had an opportunity to work with someone they did not know, and now I was able to build a classroom community as we did in Dr. Hackett's class. I explained each statement had a purpose, and we were now going to use the responses to come up with our only classroom charter. When we finished, they will sign and I would too, only if we all agreed on all the charter rules. Also, because they came up with the charter rules, I was going to hold them accountable, and they get to hold me responsible as well. The first statement lets me know what the students need from me. The second let us know what our classmates need from us to create a positive environment for them to be successful in the class. The third and fourth statements shows us how will are all different and learn in different ways, and that is okay. We must respect all people even when we think they should know something we may know already. Also, we can help each other in areas of weakness. Statement five tells us what kind of environment we would all like to have in the class, and the last statement lets me know how I can better serve them. After agreeing on the three sections of our charter, teacher expectation, classmate expectations, and student expectations, we all signed and agreed to hold each other accountable. I love that I was able to create to classroom community in which we agree to all work together.</p>

          <p>During a Summer course with Dr. Klein, a Literacy in the Content Area Professor, she told us that she could not explain what our first day of experience will be like as new teacher but it’s a feeling you will near forget. She said it is something you must just experience, with all the anxious and butterflies in your stomach. She was right. I will never forget this experience. I am lucky to say thus far even with paper work processing issues I had a great experience. I am excited to grow with my students. They have been teaching me how to remain confident in my abilities. Planning, teaching, assessing and showing empathy are all skills that I possessive naturally and my through Practicum I will get to refine my skills. This Open School Experience with my new home of Stone Mountain Middle has been the best.</p>

          <h2>Diversity Plan</h2>

          <p>
            <b>What is a diversity plan?</b> A diversity plan details how an educator will reach their students-regardless of race, ethnicity, gender, socioeconomic status, sexuality, disability status, nationality, skill level or language ability in a particular subject.
          </p>
          <p>
            I plan to teach a Middle School Mathematics class in a way that acknowledges diversity and use it as an asset to create a meaningful learning environment.
          </p>

          <p>
            To begin a plan we have to understand what our beliefs are about diversity. According to Abbe Herzig’s article in Mathematics Teacher,

            <blockquote>
              “as we work toward educating diverse students equitably in the mathematics classroom, our beliefs and goals for diversity have an important impact on our efforts” (Herzig, 2005).
            </blockquote>

            I believe that every student, regardless of background, economic status, or skill level, should have an equal opportunity to achieve a high-quality education.
          </p>

          <p>
            The first weeks of the school year, observations of students’ learning styles and habits and will occur. “One students’ learning preferences may differ from another’s based on broad issues such as developmental level, gender, race, ethnicity, socioeconomic class, or native language” (Brown &amp; Knowles, 2007, p. p. 171). Keeping track of observations will allow me to understand the individualized learning style of each student. Then I will be able to create classroom conditions to meet the needs of the different learning styles and provide the tools for success at new cognitive challenges (Brown &amp; Knowles, 2007, p. 107).  After observing students learning styles and determining if they are either visual, aural, verbal, or kinesthetic, planning lessons that tailor to each method is essential. Providing opportunities to use manipulatives, make songs about math formulas, solve problems on a whiteboard, or to use current technology, is necessary when catering to the diverse learning styles. Also providing projects and problems in the classroom that connect to the real world or the community in which the students live will promote engagement in the classroom  (Sleeter, 2005) (Herzig, 2005).  Flex learning time in the classroom will appeal to students that may need more time to complete a lesson; Collaborative learning with other students in the classroom will allow them to learn from each and expose them to people from other backgrounds. Students can use technology to research mathematicians from different ethnicity, to expose them to people they never knew about, and to identify with mathematicians that resemble themselves. I also need to “use assessments that give students authentic opportunities to demonstrate their understanding, not confounded by other skills or distractors (Shepard, 2005) (Herzig, 2005)”. Also, actively searching for diversity trainings within the county and other outside learning will keep me current on new methods and philosophies on inclusion.
          </p>

          <p>
            For students with learning, mental, and physical disabilities, I will effectively collaborate with co-teacher to make sure I am providing for the needs of these students. Modify, but challenging work that fits the cognitive level of students with learning disabilities will be provided to ensure active participation in each lesson. There should never be a time in the class when students with disabilities to feel ostracized. I want active participation from all students on any level. Reading IEPs and 504 plans to make sure accommodations for special needs students are being met are all a part of the diversity plan. Understanding the IEPs and 504 plans are crucial to providing for special needs students and creating a productive learning environment for all students.
