      <h2 class="text-2xl mb-4">Teaching Philosophy</h2>

      <p class="mb-4">
          All students have a right to an equitable education. I believe in creating a positive environment for all students of different learning styles to flourish and reach their highest learning potential. My classroom is a community that consists of a teacher, students, administration, and parents that work together to maintain order and a positive space. In my class, mistakes are to be made. We learn from our mistakes, discuss them, and plan better strategies as a community.
