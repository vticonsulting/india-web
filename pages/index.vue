      <h2 class="text-2xl mb-4">About me</h2>

      <div class="mb-4">
        <p class="mb-4 pr-56"> My name is India Lyons.  I teach sixth-grade mathematics. For ten years, I’ve worked with students from kindergarten to 8th grade in the classroom, and as a tutor and after-school counselor and director.</p>

        <p class="mb-4 pr-56">Currently, I'm a student at Georgia State University and I am a candiate for a Masters of Arts in Teaching Middle Grades. I also have a BA in Political Science with a minor in Economics from Howard University.</p>

        <p>This is my 1st year as a Math teacher at Stone Mountain Middle school, and I could not be any happier to work with the best and the brightest students that Dekalb County has to offer.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl mb-4">Teaching Philosophy</h2>

      <p class="mb-4">
          All students have a right to an equitable education. I believe in creating a positive environment for all students of different learning styles to flourish and reach their highest learning potential. My classroom is a community that consists of a teacher, students, administration, and parents working together to maintain order and a positive space. In my class, mistakes are to be made. We learn from our mistakes, discuss them, and plan better strategies as a community. I believe students can become their own facilitators in the quest of knowledge as well as peer teachers. The goal is to have a classroom that creates cooperative ownership of the learning process.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl mb-4">Class Expectations</h2>

      <p class="mb-4">
